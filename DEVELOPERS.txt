=== INSTALLING REQUIREMENTS  ===

These instructions have been tested with Ubuntu 12.04.

Install required packages, including pip for managing dependencies:
$apt-get install python-dev python-setuptools python-pip
$apt-get install libgraphviz-dev

Install the listed requirements with:
$pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don't plan to use posgresql, feel free to edit requirements.txt and delete the line:
- psycopg2==2.5

TODO: Create a requirements-dev.txt that allows to use sqlite without any edits.


=== RUN THE PROJECT LOCALLY ===
Create the db:
$python manage.py syncdb

Run the migration scripts:
$python manage.py migrate

Run the server:
$python manage.py runserver 8080

Now browse http://localhost:8080 and you should find the colibri homepage :-)
